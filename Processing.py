    """`image`(M, N[, P][, C]) ndarray
    Input image. Can be 2D or 3D, and grayscale or multichannel (see channel_axis parameter). Input image must either be NaN-free or the NaN's must be masked out.

    `n_segments` int, optional
    The (approximate) number of labels in the segmented output image.

    `compactness` float, optional
    Balances color proximity and space proximity. Higher values give more weight to space proximity, making superpixel shapes more square/cubic. In SLICO mode, this is the initial compactness. This parameter depends strongly on image contrast and on the shapes of objects in the image. We recommend exploring possible values on a log scale, e.g., 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, before refining around a chosen value.

    `max_num_iter` int, optional
    Maximum number of iterations of k-means.

    `sigmafloat` or array-like of floats, optional
    Width of Gaussian smoothing kernel for pre-processing for each dimension of the image. The same sigma is applied to each dimension in case of a scalar value. Zero means no smoothing. Note that sigma is automatically scaled if it is scalar and if a manual voxel spacing is provided (see Notes section). If sigma is array-like, its size must match imageâ€™s number of spatial dimensions.

    `spacing` array-like of floats, optional
    The voxel spacing along each spatial dimension. By default, slic assumes uniform spacing (same voxel resolution along each spatial dimension). This parameter controls the weights of the distances along the spatial dimensions during k-means clustering.

    `convert2lab` bool, optional
    Whether the input should be converted to Lab colorspace prior to segmentation. The input image must be RGB. Highly recommended. This option defaults to True when channel_axis` is not None *and* ``image.shape[-1] == 3.

    `enforce_connectivity` bool, optional
    Whether the generated segments are connected or not

    `min_size_factor` float, optional
    Proportion of the minimum segment size to be removed with respect to the supposed segment size `depth*width*height/n_segments`

    `max_size_factor` float, optional
    Proportion of the maximum connected segment size. A value of 3 works in most of the cases.

    `slic_zero` bool, optional
    Run SLIC-zero, the zero-parameter mode of SLIC. [2]

    `start_label` int, optional
    The labels' index start. Should be 0 or 1.

    New in version 0.17: start_label was introduced in 0.17

    `mask` ndarray, optional
    If provided, superpixels are computed only where mask is True, and seed points are homogeneously distributed over the mask using a k-means clustering strategy. Mask number of dimensions must be equal to image number of spatial dimensions.

    New in version 0.17: mask was introduced in 0.17

    `channel_axis` int or None, optional
    If None, the image is assumed to be a grayscale (single channel) image. Otherwise, this parameter indicates which axis of the array corresponds to channels.

    New in version 0.19: channel_axis was added in 0.19.

    # Returns:
    `labels`
    2D or 3D array
    Integer mask indicating segment labels.

    # Raises:
    ValueError
    If convert2lab is set to True but the last array dimension is not of length 3.

    ValueError
    If start_label is not 0 or 1.

    ValueError
    If image contains unmasked NaN values.

    ValueError
    If image contains unmasked infinite values.

    ValueError
    If image is 2D but channel_axis is -1 (the default).

    # Notes

    If sigma > 0, the image is smoothed using a Gaussian kernel prior to segmentation.

    If sigma is scalar and spacing is provided, the kernel width is divided along each dimension by the spacing. For example, if sigma=1 and spacing=[5, 1, 1], the effective sigma is [0.2, 1, 1]. This ensures sensible smoothing for anisotropic images.

    The image is rescaled to be in [0, 1] prior to processing (masked values are ignored).

    Images of shape (M, N, 3) are interpreted as 2D RGB images by default. To interpret them as 3D with the last dimension having length 3, use channel_axis=None.

    start_label is introduced to handle the issue [4]. Label indexing starts at 1 by default."""
